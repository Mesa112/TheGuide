## Model Details

### Random Forest Implementation
- **Features**: Year, Make, Model, Condition, Mileage, etc.
- **Target Variable**: Car Price
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Age calculation
  - Mileage per year
  - Brand category encoding
  - Condition impact factors

### Brand Categories Implementation
Implemented price boundaries for different brand categories to ensure realistic predictions:

| Category | Example Brands | Price Range |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Luxury | Rolls-Royce, Bentley | $200,000 - $600,000 |
| Premium | BMW, Mercedes | $35,000 - $150,000 |
| Mid-tier | Acura, Lincoln | $25,000 - $65,000 |
| Standard | Toyota, Honda | $17,000 - $45,000 |
| Economy | Mitsubishi | $12,000 - $35,000 |

### Price Prediction Process
1. Data preprocessing and normalization
2. Feature extraction and engineering
3. Random Forest prediction
4. Market adjustment factors application
5. Price range calculation with brand-specific boundaries

## Performance Metrics

### Model Accuracy
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: 0.83
- **Average Prediction Variance**: Â±$4,000
- **Response Time**: Real-time predictions (<2s)

### Validation Results
- Predictions consistently align with market values
- Real-time adjustments based on:
  - Vehicle condition
  - Mileage impact
  - Market trends
  - Seasonal variations
